# READ ME Generator

## Description
In this project, I made a command-line application to generate a README.md file for GitHub projects. The application prompts users to provide a description, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions. It also generates a license section based on the license the user chooses. This app allows users to quickly generate README's for future projects.
